# Yuddha : The Inception

## Story and Gameplay
The game is set in ancient India and focusses on the conquisition efforts of Alexander the Great in India. This game tries to depict the Battle of Hydaspes, fought between the great Alexander and King Potus, the erstwhile king of Punjab.

As Alexander the Great and his Greek army, we are only able to move the great king using 
1. 'w' for moving up
2. 'a' for moving towards the left
3. 's' for moving down
4. 'd' for moving towards the right
5. ' ' for attacking any building next to him
However, we provide the option to play as Queen Cleopatra to play as herself and conquer the incoming armies (and don't tell historians this but she is definitely more powerful than the king).

For Queen Cleoptra and her army, we provide the following commands to move her highness:
1. 'w' for moving up
2. 'a' for moving towards the left
3. 's' for moving down
4. 'd' for moving towards the right
5. ' ' for attacking any building in an Area of Effect (AOE), 8 tiles away from her

The greek troops, known for their power, muscle and in general, barbarianism, these troops (or for a better word, barbarians), are attacking the nearest building of King Polus. The greek troops also have amongst them archers, who can attack over walls and buildings, destroying anything in their range
regardless of whether their path to the target is blocked or not, and balloons, which prioritise attacking defensive buildings and can fly over walls and other buildings.

This distance (since the Greeks were very good mathematicians), is the Hamiltonian distance. Both Alexander the Great and Queen Cleoptra, known for their magical superpowers on the field of battle, can use 2 spells:
1. 'h' for healing the troops and himself
2. 'r' for raging the troops and himself and for them to attack faster and better

Alexander the Great can also use the Leviathan Axe, which does a lot of damage to the buildings in a 1 tile radius all around him. He can only use it once, however, to give poor King Polus a fighting chance. Queen Cleopatra, however, can use the Eagle Strike wherein she launches a volley of arrows high into the air attacking at a greater range and Area of Effect (AoE). The arrows reach the ground 1 second after being shot, dealing damage to all buildings in the
AoE.

King Polus is no mook though and with his combination of powerful cannons and mighty wizard towers, he can easily defeat the greek troops. His buildings are reinforced and the town hall, the most precious building in the Indian village, is being protected by a tight layer of walls. 

Play the game to the music of the Pirates of Caribbean and try to beat the increasingly difficult levels of the game and conquer the fertile lands of ancient India!

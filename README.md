# Yuddha : The Inception

## Story and Gameplay
The game is set in ancient India and focusses on the conquisition efforts of Alexander the Great in India. This game tries to depict the Battle of Hydaspes, fought between the great Alexander and King Potus, the erstwhile king of Punjab.

As Alexander the Great and his Greek army, we are only able to move the great king using 
1. 'w' for moving up
2. 'a' for moving towards the left
3. 's' for moving down
4. 'd' for moving towards the right

The greek troops, known for their power, muscle and in general, barbarianism, these troops (or for a better word, barbarians), are attacking the nearest building of King Polus. 
This distance (since the Greeks were very good mathematicians), is the Hamiltonian distance. Alexander the Great, known for magical on the field of battle, can use 2 spells:
1. 'h' for healing the troops and himself
2. 'r' for raging the troops and himself and for them to attack faster and better

He can also use the Leviathan Axe, which does a lot of damage to the buildings in a 1 tile radius all around him. He can only use it once, however, to give poor King Polus 
a fighting chance.

King Polus is no mook tho as he has 2 powerful cannons and can easily defeat the greek troops. His buildings are reinforced and the town hall, the most precious building in the Indian village is being protected by a tight layer of walls. 

Play the game to the music of the Pirates of Caribbean and try to win the game and conquer the fertile lands of ancient India!
